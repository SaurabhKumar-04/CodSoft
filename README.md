 My Virtual Internship at CodSoft! üéâ

I have successfully completed my Level 1 Virtual Internship at CodSoft! Throughout this journey, I have built three projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, gaining hands-on experience in frontend development, UI/UX design, and JavaScript interactivity. While these websites are in their early stages, I will continue refining and expanding them as I explore new technologies and concepts.

Here‚Äôs a glimpse of what I have built:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Personal Portfolio
A fully responsive portfolio website that highlights my skills, experience, projects, and contact details. It features an interactive UI, smooth navigation, and links to my social media profiles, offering a professional digital presence.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Study Help Landing Page
A simple webpage designed to help students explore study resources, purchase courses, ask questions, and access subject notes. Although it‚Äôs still in progress, I will expand it with more functionalities in future.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Calci ‚Äì A Calculator
A basic yet functional JavaScript calculator that performs arithmetic operations seamlessly. It features a clean UI, real-time calculations, and smooth interactions for an efficient user experience.
